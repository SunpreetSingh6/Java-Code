		HCQL :- Hibernate Criteria Query Language		
		HCQL :- The Hibernate Criteria Query Language (HCQL) is used to fetch the records based on the specific criteria. 
				The Criteria interface provides methods to apply criteria such as retreiving all the records of table 
				whose salary is greater than 50000 etc.
				
		Advantage :- The HCQL provides methods to add criteria, so it is easy for the java programmer to add criteria. 
					 The java programmer is able to add many criteria on a query.
