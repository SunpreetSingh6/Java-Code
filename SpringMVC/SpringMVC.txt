	1) Configure DispatcherServlet in web.xml
	2) Create Spring Configuration file. (Have to create this file along with web.xml)

	-> To send data from controller to view(There are 2 ways to send data)
	
	1) Model :- using method    addAttribute(String key , Object value); 
			* This data send by Model will be stored in HttpServletRequest and we can get that data
			  using request.getAttribute(key) now this method will return object of object and we have to
			  typecast it to our desired type . We can write this method in scriplet tag<% %>

	2) ModelAndView :- using method    addObject(String key , Object value);
			* We can set the view using setViewName("")  
		**	Checkout help function in HomeController	**
		
		*** We can also get data from JSP ExpressionLanguage ***
			We can get it using ${key}
			Since ExpressionLanguage is disabled in JSP we have enable it using
			<%@page isELIgnored= "false" %> 
			If we want to get Collection then we have to use JSTL.
