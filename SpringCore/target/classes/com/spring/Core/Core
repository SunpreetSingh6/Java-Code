	The core module contains 4 parts
		core,bean,context,spExpression
		
		Core and bean provides the fundamental concepts like of spring framework like dependency injection and 
		IOC i.e inversion of control. 
		
		Context module inherits the properties from bean module that means it has all the properties of bean module and it's 
		own features like Internationalization,Event propagation,Resource allocation,Transparent creation of object. 
		context also provides the J2EE features like EJB,JMS,Basic Remoting.
		
		
		
		IOC Container :- IOC container is responsible for creating the object of the bean,hold the object into the memory and
						 inject the object into required bean. It also manages the lifecycle of the object.
						 			 
						 It takes 2 things :- bean(class) name which it needs to manage , and configuration file.
						 
		There are two types of IOC container :-
			1) BeanFactory(interface)
			2) ApplicationContext(interface)
			
			Since ApplicationContext is built on top of BeanFactory that means it has some more features.
			So we will be using ApplicationContext as our IOC container.
			
			Since ApplicationContext is an interface so we cannot create object of it.
			hence we use its implementation
				1) ClassPathXmlApplicationContext :- when we have xml config file in our classpath
				2) AnnotaionConfigApplicationContext :- when we are doing configuration using annotation
				3) FileSystemXmlApplicationContext :- when we have config file in our file system.
